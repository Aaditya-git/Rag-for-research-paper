In this paper, we introduce LMSYS-Chat-1M, a large-scale dataset\ncontaining one million real-world conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs. This dataset is collected from 210K unique IP addresses in the wild on our\nVicuna demo and Chatbot Arena website.

As a consequence, there is a pressing need to study the interaction between humans and LLM\ntechnology. For example, as users engage with LLMs, they change their behaviors by adopting\ndomain-specific queries and question formats. Unraveling these patterns can offer insights into user\nexpectations and trust regarding different LLMs. Beyond general behavior, understanding the spec-\ntrum of questions—ranging from simple factual queries to complex, context-heavy questions—can\nimprove LLMs to cater better to user needs, avoid misuse, and improve AI safety. However, studying these topics requires access to a dataset of diverse, real-user queries posted to\ndifferent LLMs. Unfortunately, such a dataset remains elusive in the research community, for the\nfollowing reasons.",

First, the operational costs associated with hosting an LLM service are pro-\nhibitively high for most entities. Second, wealthy commercial LLM vendors, despite having a vast\namount of user queries, often hold back from disclosing the dataset, due to competitive concerns\nand the proprietary nature of the data. Third, there is an inherent difficulty in incentivizing users\nto interact with multiple, open LLMs, due to their lackluster performance compared to commercial\nmodels, which adds difficulty to creating such a large-scale multi-LLM conversation dataset.

Let’s start by finding\nthe total number of apples and\noranges you want to have after\nbuying the additional fruit.

Since we\ncurrently have 4000 apples and\n2500 oranges, we need to add the\nsame number of each to reach a\ntotal of 8500 pieces of fruit.
